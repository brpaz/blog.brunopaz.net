## Build with

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Casper Two](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-casper-two/) theme.

## Development

The recommended way is to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start a new container with live reload enabled and with 1313 port exposed.

You can then access the site from: `http://localhost:1313`

## Deployment

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is used for deployment of the site.
